1. To compile the code successfully, you need to have the libunbound
library first. Normally the library is installed together with unbound.
Please make sure the libunbound is installed in the path which gcc will
search automaticaly by default.

Or you could include your libunbound path in the Makefile. For example, 
you could append "-Wl,-rpath=/your/path" to the original CFLAGS. After
compiling, you could check the link path by using "ldd ping64".
