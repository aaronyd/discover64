1. To compile the code successfully, you need to have the libunbound
library first. Normally the library is installed together with unbound.
Please make sure the libunbound is installed in the path which gcc will
search automaticaly by default.

Or you could include your libunbound path in the Makefile. For example, 
you could append "-Wl,-rpath=/your/path" to the original CFLAGS. After
compiling, you could check the link path by using "ldd ping64".

2. To enable the security validating function, please use -s and -k
<your keys file> together with ./ping64. The -k parameter is to
indicate the DNSSEC keys file, both DNSKEY or DS record is ok. For
example
    dig aaaa DNSKEY nl > keys
    ./ping64 -s -k keys -u nlnetlabs.nl www.helsinki.fi
